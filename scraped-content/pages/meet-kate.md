### Kate Edelstein

Welcome to my world of holistic wellness and vibrant energy! I embarked on my journey in the Holistic Wellness space back in 2015, and since then, my path has been illuminated by my deep connection to the Earth, plants, and the cosmic energies that surround us.

I'm Kate Edelstein, the founder of SERPRANA and an Alchemist of Sound, Energy, and Herbal Medicine based in Playa Venao, Panama. Through my work, I empower individuals on their healing and transformation journeys. Using my intuition (clairvoyance, clairaudience, and clairsentience), deep connection to Nature, and ability to conduct energy, I guide others in aligning with their highest potential. I'm certified in Reiki 1 & 2, Herbalism, Permaculture, and Spiritual Release Therapy (SRT), blending ancient wisdom with modern practices to create profound, transformative experiences.

My work spans festivals, retreats, and community collaborations. I have performed at Radio Venao, Reactor Venao, and Yoga Gathering Venao for the past three years, including the Opening Ceremony Sound Bath for Radio Venao. I also facilitate sound journeys and sound workshops for retreats across Panama.

Deeply influenced by time spent with the Kogi and Wiwa Tribes of the Sierra Nevada, I honor their ancestral teachings through ongoing Pagamentos and monthly meetings. Rooted in these practices, I align my work with my vision for "New Earth," fostering harmony between humanity and nature while inspiring sustainable and regenerative ways of living.

Through my work, I empower others to embrace their unique gifts, deepen their connection to nature and themselves, and align with their highest potential, creating a ripple effect of healing and transformation.
